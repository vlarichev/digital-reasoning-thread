## Executive Summary

In complex industrial systems, AI is often siloed, inconsistent, or blind to the reasoning behind decisions. The **Digital Reasoning Thread** introduces a new architecture that connects context, assumptions, logic, and outcomes across tools and processes.

This paper outlines the concept, a reference architecture, and early applications across engineering, manufacturing, and asset operations.

## What is a Digital Reasoning Thread?

The DRT is a persistent, toolchain-spanning logic layer that stores **decisions, justifications, assumptions**, and **context** ‚Äì allowing agents and humans to operate more consistently across complex toolchains.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just a data thread. It‚Äôs a reasoning thread.‚Äù

It complements data platforms and knowledge graphs by adding **traceable, explainable, dynamic logic**.

## Reference Architecture

üõ† *[Diagram placeholder ‚Äì Coming soon in `/assets/architecture.png`]*

- Perception Layer: sensors, logs, documents  
- Knowledge Layer: structured models, ontologies  
- Reasoning Layer: traceable logic, chains of thought  
- Execution Layer: automation, robotics, MES, ERP  
- Feedback Loop: learning from system behavior

---

## Use Cases

- **Engineering orchestration**: maintaining reasoning across CAE, PLM, and simulation  
- **Manufacturing optimization**: linking MES decisions with simulation assumptions  
- **AI agents for documentation**: enabling traceable, explainable outputs from autonomous agents

---

## KPIs & Success Metrics

- Cycle time reduction in decision loops  
- Number of traceable decisions  
- Fewer handover losses between departments/tools  
- Auditability score of AI-generated results
