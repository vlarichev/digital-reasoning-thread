# Digital Reasoning Thread

Welcome to the **Digital Reasoning Thread (DRT)** – a new architectural approach to unify reasoning, data, and decisions across industrial processes.

This repo hosts:
- 📝 The open whitepaper in Markdown & PDF
- 🎯 Diagrams and assets
- 🌍 Live version at: https://vlarichev.github.io/digital-reasoning-thread/

## Why this matters

Industrial systems often capture what happened – but not *why*.  
DRT introduces a persistent reasoning layer to connect logic across engineering, simulation, automation, and execution.
