# Digital Reasoning Thread

**Bridging data, tools, and decisions with a persistent reasoning layer for industrial AI.**

The **Digital Reasoning Thread (DRT)** introduces a new way of thinking: capturing not only the data, but also the *why* behind each step in engineering, manufacturing, and operations.

- âœ… Connects simulation, automation, documentation, and execution
- âœ… Maintains traceable context and logic across the lifecycle
- âœ… Accelerates iteration, reduces transition loss, and enables trustworthy agent-based systems

## Why this matters

Most digital systems track *what* was done. DRT also tracks *why*.  
This shift is essential for truly intelligent, safe, and scalable AI in industry.
